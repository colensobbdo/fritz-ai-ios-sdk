## Fritz AI

Fritz AI is the machine learning platform for iOS and Android developers. Teach your mobile apps to see, hear, sense, and think. Get started quickly with [our pre-trained APIs](https://www.fritz.ai/product/pretrained.html?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=swift-sdk), or use [our end-to-end platform](https://www.fritz.ai/product/studio.html?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=swift-sdk) to build and deploy your own custom models.

If you're ready to start building mobile apps powered by ML, [sign up](https://www.fritz.ai/pricing/?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=swift-sdk) for a Fritz AI plan to get started.

## Installation

[iOS SDK instructions](https://docs.fritz.ai/get-started.html#ios)

In order to clone the project, you must first install Git Large File Storage (LFS), [available here](https://git-lfs.github.com). The `MLModel` files are checked into the repo using LFS and will not clone properly otherwise.

If you already have the repo cloned, you can run `git lfs pull` to get the new files.
