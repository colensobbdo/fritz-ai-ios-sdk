# SDK Unit Testing Example Responses

This folder contains example API responses from the Fritz API.

For example, if you are making an API request to `/model/digits/active`, the contents of the corresponding file will be returned.

This data should be stored in an bucket in S3. The data is _not_ updated automatically. If you make any changes locally, please update the files in S3 (would like to add an invoke task to automatically update the S3 data in the future).
